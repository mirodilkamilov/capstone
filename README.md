## Abstract
This abstract summarizes the final year project, which aimed to develop an autonomous SmartCar using a Raspberry Pi-3 kit for competition track missions. The project involved independent study in Electrical Engineering, Programming, Embedded Systems, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning. Extensive research was conducted, exploring literature and online resources related to intelligent car assembly, Raspberry Pi, motor control, sensor integration, and image processing.

The initial phase involved assembling the SmartCar kit and setting up the Raspberry Pi OS. An experimental design focused on motor control and Ultrasonic sensor integration for obstacle avoidance. Lane detection was implemented using the Raspberry Pi camera module and image processing techniques.

The project's culmination involved developing an algorithm to enable self-driving capabilities by integrating Ultrasonic sensor input and algorithms to detect lanes and recognize traffic color.

Throughout the project, comprehensive reports were prepared, demonstrating independent research, problem-solving, and application of scientific methods. The project showcased the student's technical expertise, ability to work independently and in a team, and proficiency in conducting research and solving real-world problems.
